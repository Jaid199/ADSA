   - Segment Tree and Fenwick Tree
   - Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

2. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Advanced shortest path algorithms
   - Network flow algorithms
   - Strongly Connected Components

3. **String Algorithms**
   - KMP Algorithm
   - Rabin-Karp Algorithm
   - Suffix Arrays

4. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Advanced DP techniques
   - Optimization problems

5. **Advanced Algorithmic Paradigms**
